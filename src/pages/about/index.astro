					<h1>About CyberFern</h1>
				</header>

					based in Wellington, New Zealand. Anna helps organisations see
					cybersecurity not as a technical burden, but as a strategic enabler of
					growth and resilience.

				<h2>Background</h2>
			</header>
			<div>
				<p>
					Anna's career spans both sides of the security divide. As a full-stack
					and DevSecOps engineer, she has built and secured the systems that
					organisations depend on. She understands the technical challenges
					security teams face{md}not from a textbook, but from the command line.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her academic background is equally distinctive: a Master's degree in
					Sociology, an MBA, and a Diploma in Machine Learning and Artificial
					Intelligence. This combination of technical depth and human science
					gives Anna a perspective that most security consultants simply don't
					have.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anna has founded and run her own startups, giving her first-hand
					insight into the pressures founders face when balancing growth with
					risk.

				<h2>Approach</h2>
			</header>
			<div>
				<p>
					Anna bridges boardrooms and server rooms. Her background in sociology,
					business management, and communications enables her to frame technical
					challenges in language that resonates with executives and stakeholders{
						md
					}while her engineering experience ensures that advice is grounded in
					practical reality.
				</p>
				<p>
					CyberFern's work is practical, proportionate, and human-centred. Anna
					doesn't sell fear or push unnecessary complexity. She helps
					organisations understand their real risk picture and take sensible
					steps to address it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Known for her engaging and practical teaching style, Anna helps
					participants walk away with tools they can use immediately{md}whether
					that's presenting to the board, building a security roadmap, or making
					smarter investment decisions.
