			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
				We collect personal information from you <strong>only</strong> when contact
				us by phone or email, so you are in full control of what is collected. Any
				information we collect, such as your email address or phone number, will
				be collected <strong>only</strong> for the purpose of contacting you or providing
				the services you have requested.
				<p>
					<strong
						>We do not collect or use your personal information for any purpose
						other than those given above.</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Providing this information to us is optional. We do not share your
					information with other parties. Ever. If you do not provide contact
					details, then you will not receive communications from us. It is up to
					you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do provide personal information, then we keep it safe. We do so
					by storing it securely offline. These data are accessible only by
					CyberFern.
				</p>
				<p>
					That said, we presume that the employees of the online data services
					can access the data as well. Currently, we use two services.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have the right to ask us what personal information we have of
					yours. We will make any corrections you desire or delete your
					information at your request. If youʼd like to ask for a copy of your
					information, or to have it corrected, please <a
						href="mailto:info@cyberfern.com">contact us.</a
					>
				</p>
				<h2>Secure server</h2>
				<p>
					We serve the CyberFern.com site using <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
						rel="external"
						>Transport Layer Security</a
					> (TLS). This encrypts communications between your browser and our server,
					ensuring your privacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use of <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> is the current
					industry best practice and helps to ensure both your privacy and your security.
				</p>
				<h2>Privacy by Design</h2>
				<p>
					We do our best to follow the seven <a
						href="https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html"
						rel="external"
						>Privacy by Design</a
					> principles:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Proactive not reactive; preventive not remedial</li>
					<li>Privacy as the default setting</li>
					<li>Privacy embedded into design</li>
					<li>Full functionality — positive-sum, not zero-sum</li>
					<li>End-to-end security — full lifecycle protection</li>
					<li>Visibility and transparency — keep it open</li>
					<li>Respect for user privacy — keep it user-centric</li>
				</ol>
