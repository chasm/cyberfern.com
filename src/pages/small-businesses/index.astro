					At CyberFern, we help small business owners understand their real
					risks and take sensible steps to protect what matters{md}their
					customers, their reputation, and their livelihood.

				<h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="card one">
				<h3>"We're too small to be a target"</h3>
				<p>
					Small businesses are actually targeted more often than large ones,
					because attackers know they usually have weaker defences. You don't
					need to be a big name to lose money, data, or customer trust.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card two">
				<h3>"We outsource our IT"</h3>
				<p>
					Having an IT provider doesn't mean your security is covered. Most IT
					support focuses on keeping things running{md}not on protecting you
					from threats. It's worth knowing what's actually included and what
					gaps remain.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card three">
				<h3>"We're not really digital"</h3>
				<p>
					If you use email, process payments, or store customer details, you're
					more digital than you think. A single compromised inbox or leaked
					spreadsheet can cause real harm to your business and your customers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card four">
				<h3>"We'll deal with it later"</h3>
				<p>
					The longer you wait, the more you're leaving to chance. A few simple
					steps now can prevent the kind of problems that are far more expensive{
						md
					}and stressful{md}to fix after the fact.

				<h2>What to Expect</h2>
			</header>
			<div>
				<p>
					Your free one-hour consultation is a relaxed, no-pressure conversation
					about where your business stands today. Anna has helped businesses of
					all sizes, and she understands that most owners just want to know: "Am
					I doing enough?"
				</p>
				<p>
					In that hour, you'll get a plain-language picture of your biggest
					risks, practical advice on what to do first, and honest answers to
					your questions{md}whether that involves CyberFern or not.
